#### In this project, I designed a real estate price prediction website. The model was built using sklearn and linear regression using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. Using python, a flask server was created that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests. The website is built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to enter their home square ft area, bedrooms, etc., to retrieve the predicted price. Technologies used,

#### Python
#### Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
#### Matplotlib for data visualization
#### Sklearn for model building
#### Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
#### Python flask for http server
#### HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
